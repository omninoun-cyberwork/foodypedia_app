# Fix: Frontend Start Issue

The command `npm run dev` failed because it was executed in the project root directory, but the frontend code (including [package.json](file:///C:/Foodypedia/frontend/package.json)) is located in the `frontend/` subdirectory.

## Proposed Changes

No code changes are required. The fix involves navigating to the correct directory before running the command.

### Manual Steps
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory: `cd frontend`
2. Run the development server: `npm run dev`

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- I will run `npm run dev` from within the `C:\Foodypedia\frontend` directory and verify that the Next.js development server starts successfully.
