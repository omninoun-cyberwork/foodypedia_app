# Fix: Django ModuleNotFoundError

The error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'django'` occurred because the required dependencies are installed in a virtual environment named `fenv`, which was not activated.

## Steps Taken

1.  **Diagnosed Environment**: I checked the project directory and found a virtual environment folder named `fenv`.
2.  **Verified Installation**: I verified that Django and other dependencies are correctly installed within the `fenv` environment.
3.  **Verified Server Run**: I confirmed that running [manage.py](file:///C:/Foodypedia/manage.py) using the Python executable from the `fenv` environment works without errors.

## Solution

To run the server, you need to activate the virtual environment first.

### For PowerShell (current shell):
```powershell
.\fenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python manage.py runserver
```

### For Command Prompt (CMD):
```cmd
.\fenv\Scripts\activate.bat
python manage.py runserver
```

### Alternative (without activation):
You can also run the command directly using the virtual environment's Python:
```powershell
.\fenv\Scripts\python manage.py runserver
```
